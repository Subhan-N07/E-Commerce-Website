# E-Commerce-Website
A sleek, responsive, and fully functional e-commerce frontend built exclusively with HTML, CSS (Grid/Flexbox for layout), and JavaScript. This project focuses on a clean user experience and fundamental web development skills.

A boilerplate e-commerce project emphasizing mastery of core web technologies. This is a great starting point for developers looking to understand how to build complex, stateful applications without relying on large libraries or frameworks.

Technologies Used:

HTML5: Semantic structure.
CSS3: Flexbox and Grid layouts, CSS variables.
JavaScript (ES6+): Object-Oriented principles, Array methods (map, filter, reduce), and efficient DOM manipulation.
